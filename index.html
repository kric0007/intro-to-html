            <p>Hi there! I am from Brazil, but I call Canada home for almost a decade now. I have a degree in Pharmacy back home, and when I moved here I had to start over, so my plan was to become a cook. I have always been passionate about food and flavours, and how all that comes together, not only in a practical, but also in a visual way. So I tried to combine both my passion with my career, and it worked so far.</p>
            <p>A few years passed and I started to feel a little stuck - my creative side was dorment and I couldn't express myself. Then, once again, it was time to move away from the confort zone. I created courage to start something that I never have planned on doing again: Persue a whole new career in Media Design - overcome my limits and achive new dreams, that is my new plan for this part of my life. </p>
